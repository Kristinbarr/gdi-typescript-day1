# Before we get started

Make sure you have a recent version of Node.js (v8+) installed (we recommend using [NVM](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) to update to a recent version)

Install [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or a TypeScript Intellisense plugin for your favorite text editor.

```bash
$ git clone github.com/VICEMedia/gdi-typescript-day1
$ cd gdi-typescript-day1/exercise
```

# TypeScript

TypeScript is a transpiled programming language that adds a type system to JavaScript.

```notes
This portion is direct teach. Students should be listening and possibly taking notes, but not coding along
```

---

```typescript
// TypeScript input
interface Greeting {
  name: string;
  greet: () => void;
}

class SayHello implements Greeting {
  name: string;

  constructor(name: string) {
    this.name = name;
  }

  greet = () => {
    console.log(`Hello, ${this.name}`);
  }
}
const greetEveryone = new SayHello('World');
greetEveryone.greet();
```

---

```js
// JavaScript output
class SayHello {
  constructor(name) {
      this.greet = () => {
          console.log(`Hello, ${this.name}`);
      };
      this.name = name;
  }
}
const greetEveryone = new SayHello('World');
greetEveryone.greet();
```

---

## Compile-Time Checks

Compile-time checks allow us to enforce that our program will execute properly without having to run it.

```typescript
add(5, '2');
// Argument of type '"2"' is not assignable to parameter of type 'number'.
```

---

## Collaboration

When working on larger projects, not all members of a team may have complete knowledge of the codebase.

TypeScript helps contributors glean the input and output of a function and infer what a data structure should look like in order for a part of the application to work properly.

```typescript
function generateArticle(title: string, body: string, author: User): Article {
  ...
}
```

## Intellisense

// TODO Example gif of Intellisense in action

---

# Drawbacks

* Transpiled JavaScript
* Additional overhead when writing code
* Additional overhead when debugging code

---

# This lesson will cover

* setting up a TypeScript project
* the type system & type annotations
* type inference
* writing & implementing interfaces
* any types & type assertions
* putting together classes, interfaces, and types

```notes
Now is the time for students to begin typing along
```

---

# Getting Started

Let's go through the basic project setup.

```bash
$ npm init
$ npm install typescript
$ npm install ts-node
```

```notes
For this section we'll be going through basic setup and writing first types together.
This is a code-along, so we'll pause at each slide to switch to the text editor.
Make sure to explain why we're using ts-node
```

---

Add a command to run your scripts

```json
{
  "name": "exercises",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "ts-node"
  },
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC",
  "dependencies": {
    "ts-node": "^8.0.2",
    "typescript": "^3.3.3333"
  }
}
```

```notes
The only thing that's noteworthy here is the "scripts" object
```

# The Type System

The means by which the TypeScript transpiler can perform compile-time checks to see if your code is type safe

---

<CodeSurfer
  title='What does TypeScript syntax look like?'
  code={require('!raw-loader!./snippets/syntax-example.ts')}
  lang='typescript'
  steps={[
    { notes: 'Let\'s look at a few examples' },
    { tokens: { 1: [2, 3, 4] }, notes: 'Most type declarations follow this syntax' },
    { tokens: { 2: [6, 7, 8] }, notes: 'We can use the same syntax for a funtion\s parameters...' },
    { tokens: { 2: [10, 11, 12] }, notes: '... as well as a function\'s return type' },
  ]}
/>

```notes
No code-along here, but take a minute to discuss how a variables type cannot change
```

---

## Common TypeScript types

```typescript
// Boolean
var myBool: boolean = true;

// Number
var myNum: number = 6;
var myFloat: number = 6.6;
var myHex: number = 0xf00d;

// String
var myString: string = 'Hello World';

// Array
var myArr: number[] = [6, 23, 4.8];
```

---

# Type Inference

The TypeScript compiler will predict the type annotations for a given variable based upon possible values for that variable

// TODO make this thematic

```typescript
var myNum = 6;
// myNum: number
```

```notes
This slide should inclide a short live demo of type inference in action
```

---

# Interfaces

Interfaces are used to describe the structure of an object.

Interfaces can be implemented by classes or by objects.

```notes
This is a good opportunity to check familiarity with interfaces
```

---

# What is an 'any' type?

An `any` type is used to describe the type of a variable that we are unsure of at the time of writing.

`any` is helpful when migrating an existing JavaScript application onto TypeScript.

```notes
any can also be a helpful way of getting the transpiler to compile your code while developing a feature
```

---

# Writing and implementing an interface

```notes
This is a live coding section
```

---

// TODO add a guided practice

---

// TODO add optional homework

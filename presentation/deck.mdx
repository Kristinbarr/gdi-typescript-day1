# Before we get started

Make sure you have a recent version of Node.js (v8+) installed (we recommend using [NVM](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) to update to a recent version)

Install [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or a TypeScript Intellisense plugin for your favorite text editor.

```bash
$ git clone github.com/VICEMedia/gdi-typescript-day1
$ cd gdi-typescript-day1/exercise
```

# TypeScript

TypeScript is a transpiled programming language that adds a type system to JavaScript.

```notes
This portion is direct teach. Students should be listening and possibly taking notes, but not coding along
```

---

```typescript
// TypeScript input
interface Greeting {
  name: string;
  greet: () => void;
}

class SayHello implements Greeting {
  name: string;

  constructor(name: string) {
    this.name = name;
  }

  greet = () => {
    console.log(`Hello, ${this.name}`);
  }
}
const greetEveryone = new SayHello('World');
greetEveryone.greet();
```

---

```js
// JavaScript output
class SayHello {
  constructor(name) {
      this.greet = () => {
          console.log(`Hello, ${this.name}`);
      };
      this.name = name;
  }
}
const greetEveryone = new SayHello('World');
greetEveryone.greet();
```

---

## Compile-Time Checks

Compile-time checks allow us to enforce that our program will execute properly without having to run it.

```typescript
add(5, 'two');
// Argument of type '"two"' is not assignable to parameter of type 'number'.
```

---

## Collaboration

When working on larger projects, not all members of a team may have complete knowledge of the codebase.

TypeScript helps contributors glean the input and output of a function and infer what a data structure should look like in order for a part of the application to work properly.

```typescript
function generateArticle(title: string, body: string, author: User): Article {
  ...
}
```

# Drawbacks

* Transpiled JavaScript
* Additional overhead when writing code
* Additional overhead when debugging code

---

# This lesson will cover

* setting up a TypeScript project
* the type system & type annotations
* type inference
* writing & implementing interfaces
* any types & type assertions
* putting together classes, interfaces, and types

```notes
Now is the time for students to begin typing along
```

---

# Getting Started

Let's go through the basic project setup.

```bash
$ npm init
$ npm install typescript
$ npm install ts-node
```

```notes
For this section we'll be going through basic setup and writing first types together.
This is a code-along, so we'll pause at each slide to switch to the text editor.
Make sure to explain why we're using ts-node
```

---

Add a command to run your scripts

```json
{
  "name": "exercises",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "ts-node"
  },
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC",
  "dependencies": {
    "ts-node": "^8.0.2",
    "typescript": "^3.3.3333"
  }
}
```

```notes
The only thing that's noteworthy here is the "scripts" object
```

# The Type System

How the TypeScript transpiler can perform compile-time checks to see if your code is type safe

<CodeSurfer
  title='What does TypeScript syntax look like?'
  code={require('!raw-loader!./snippets/syntax-example.ts')}
  lang='typescript'
  steps={[
    { notes: 'Let\'s look at a few examples' },
    { lines: [1], notes: 'Variable declaration' },
    { tokens: { 1: [2, 3, 4] }, notes: 'Most type declarations follow this syntax' },
    { lines: [2], notes: 'Function signature' },
    { tokens: { 2: [6, 7, 8] }, notes: 'We can use the same syntax for a funtion\s parameters...' },
    { tokens: { 2: [10, 11, 12] }, notes: '... as well as a function\'s return type' },
  ]}
/>

```notes
No code-along here, but take a minute to discuss how a variables type cannot change
```

---

## Common TypeScript types

```typescript
// Boolean
var myBool: boolean = true;

// Number
var myNum: number = 6;
var myFloat: number = 6.6;
var myHex: number = 0xf00d;

// String
var myString: string = 'Hello World';

// Array
var myArr: number[] = [6, 23, 4.8];
```

---

# Type Inference

The TypeScript compiler will predict the type annotations for a given variable based upon possible values for that variable

```typescript
var color = 'red';
// color: string
```

```notes
This slide should include a short live demo of type inference in action
```

---

# Interfaces

Interfaces are used to describe the structure of an object.

Interfaces can be implemented by classes or by objects.

```notes
This is a good opportunity to check familiarity with interfaces
```

---

# Writing an interface

```typescript
interface Flower {
  petals: number;
  height: number;
  color: string;
  fragrence: boolean;
}
```

```notes
This is a live coding section. We'll write a Flower interface together
```

---

# Implementing an interface

```typescript
class Tulip implements Flower {
  petals = 6;
  height = 0;
  color = 'pink';
  fragrence = true;
}
```

```notes
We'll live code the class above, but we'll also add add a constructor so that color can be set
```
---

# Initializing classes

```typescript
const myTulip = new Tulip('yellow');
```

---

<CodeSurfer
  title='Breaking down the function signature'
  code={require('!raw-loader!./snippets/function-example.ts')}
  lang='typescript'
  steps={[
    { notes: 'What does a TypeScript function look like?' },
    { tokens: { 1: [4, 5, 6, 7, 8] }, notes: 'Parameters can be typed in-line as so' },
    { tokens: { 1: [9, 10, 11, 12] }, notes: 'Return types can be inferred by the compiler, but are better strongly typed' },
  ]}
/>

```notes
This part is a code-along. Talk through how the compiler can infer the returned Flower[]
```

---

# What is an 'any' type?

An `any` type is used to describe the type of a variable that we are unsure of at the time of writing.

`any` is helpful when migrating an existing JavaScript application onto TypeScript, but should be avoided in production-quality code.

```notes
any can also be a helpful way of getting the transpiler to compile your code while developing a feature
This slide should prompt writing out an order. Start by hard-coding the object, and then writing the interface itself
```

---

<CodeSurfer
  title='Optional fields'
  code={require('!raw-loader!./snippets/optional-example.ts')}
  lang='typescript'
  steps={[
    { notes: 'Let\'s modify the Order interface' },
    { tokens: { 3: [1] }, notes: 'The "?" denotes a field that may be null or undefined' },
  ]}
/>

---

# Let's build a garden

* Add another class that implements `Flower` to your garden
* Modify your `createBouquet()` function and `Order` interface to return the correct `Flower`s based on a `type: string` field
* Add a `height` (in centimeters) to your `Flower` interface and make sure that all of your `Flower`s implement it properly
* Add a `water()` function to your `Flower` interface which
  * takes an amount of `milliliters` as an argument and
  * grows your `Tulip`'s height by 1cm per every 100ml of water
  * grows your other `Flower`'s heights 1cm per different amounts of water

**BONUS**

* Write a new function that takes `Order[]` as an argument and returns a bouquet of `Flower[]`
  * Your order should have an interface for the `type`, `color`, and `amount` of flowers

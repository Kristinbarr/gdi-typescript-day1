# Before we get started

Make sure you have a recent version of Node.js (v8+) installed (we recommend using [NVM](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) to update to a recent version)

Install [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or a TypeScript Intellisense plugin for your favorite text editor.

```bash
$ git clone github.com/VICEMedia/gdi-typescript-day1
$ cd gdi-typescript-day1/exercise
```

# TypeScript

TypeScript is a transpiled programming language that adds a type system to JavaScript.

---

// TODO Example of TypeScript code transpiled to JavaScript

---

## Collaboration

When working on larger projects, not all members of a team may have complete knowledge of the codebase. TypeScript helps contributors glean the input and output of a function and infer what a data structure should look like in order for a part of the application to function properly.

---

## Intellisense

// TODO Example gif of Intellisense in action

---

# Drawbacks

* Transpiled JavaScript
* Additional overhead when writing code
* Additional overhead when debugging code

---

# This lesson will cover

* setting up a TypeScript project
* the type system & type annotations
* type inference
* writing & implementing interfaces
* any types & type assertions
* using npm to fetch type definitions for a package
* creating an Express app from the ground up using TypeScript

---

# Getting Started

Let's go through the basic project setup.

```bash
$ npm init
$ npm install typescript
$ npm install ts-node
```

```notes
For this section we'll be going through basic setup and writing first types together.
This is a code-along, so we'll pause at each slide to switch to the text editor.
```

---

Add a command to run your scripts

// TODO verify that this "run" works as expected. It may not since "npm run" is reserved

```json
{
  "name": "exercises",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "run": "ts-node"
  },
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC",
  "dependencies": {
    "ts-node": "^8.0.2",
    "typescript": "^3.3.3333"
  }
}
```

```notes
The only thing that's noteworthy here is the "scripts" object
```

# The Type System

The means by which TypeScript checks to see if your code is type safe

---

<CodeSurfer
  title='What does TypeScript syntax look like?'
  code={require('!raw-loader!./snippets/syntax-example.ts')}
  lang='typescript'
  steps={[
    { notes: 'Let\'s look at a few examples' },
    { tokens: { 1: [2, 3, 4] }, notes: 'Most type declarations follow this syntax' },
    { tokens: { 2: [6, 7, 8] }, notes: 'We can use the same syntax for a funtion\s parameters...' },
    { tokens: { 2: [10, 11, 12] }, notes: '... as well as a function\'s return type' },
  ]}
/>

```notes
No code-along here, but take a minute to discuss how a variables type cannot change
```

---

## Common TypeScript types

```typescript
// Boolean
const myBool: boolean = true;

// Number
const myNum: number = 6;
const myFloat: number = 6.6;
const myHex: number = 0xf00d;

// String
const myString: string = 'Hello World';

// Array
const myArr: number[] = [6, 23, 4.8];
```

---

# Type Inference

The TypeScript compiler will predict the type annotations for a given variable based upon possible values for that variable

```notes
This slide should inclide a short live demo of type inference in action
```

---

# Interfaces

Interfaces are used to describe the structure of an object.

Interfaces can be implemented by classes or by objects.

```notes
This is a good opportunity to check familiarity with interfaces
```

---

# What is an 'any' type?

An `any` type is used to describe the type of a variable that we are unsure of at the time of writing.

`any` is helpful when migrating an existing JavaScript application onto TypeScript.

```notes
any can also be a helpful way of getting the transpiler to compile your code while developing a feature
```

---

# Writing and implementing an interface

```notes
This is a live coding section
```

---

# NPM packages and @types

Type annotations for NPM packages can be downloaded by using the `@types/` prefix. Let's use [request promise native](https://github.com/request/request-promise-native) as an example

```bash
$ npm install --save request
$ npm install --save request-promise-native
$ npm install --save @types/request-promise-native
```

```notes
This slide should include a quick live demo of the downloaded types working in VS Code
```

---

# Let's make an Express app

* write a `/roll-call` route that responds with all monsters' names
* add a `Food` enum and give each monster an array of `foodSources`
* write a `/:name/feed?foodSource=brains&units=2` route which checks if the food you feed a monster is valid
* add an `Attack` enum and give each monster an array of `weaknesses`
* write a `/:name/attack?source=stake` route which checks to see if the monster can be defeated by the attack and deletes it if the attack succeeds
* BONUS: add unit tests using Mocha/Chai
* BONUS: save your monsters to MongoDB or a database of your choice

```notes
This slide will be a code-along in which we get the basic application set up, and then students will go off and work on their own

Install dependencies

npm init
npm install --save typescript
npm install --save express

mkdir src
touch src/app.ts

Start writing app.get and pause to get type annotations

npm install --save-dev @types/express

Finish writing app.get with a simple 'Hello' response and add app.listen

Setup tsconfig.json and then package.json start command

npm install --save-dev nodemon
touch nodemon.json

Update package.json to use the nodemon config

Setup hashmap of monsters
```
